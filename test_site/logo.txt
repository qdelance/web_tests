I think the power of using background images is amazing. Whenever you need to display text as an image due to fonts or for something like a logo, it’s easy to make it work and keep it 100% accessible. This is not rocket science, but it’s important. For instance, if I wanted to display a logo. The wrong way: <img src="logo.gif" alt="Company Logo" /> The right way:
01	XHTML:
02	 
03	<h1 id="logo">Company Name</h1>
04	 
05	CSS:
06	 
07	h1 {
08	height:100px /* height of logo */
09	width:100px /* width of logo */
10	background:url(logo.gif) no-repeat;
11	text-indent:-9000px;
12	}
